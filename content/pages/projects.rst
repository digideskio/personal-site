my daily researches and demands. Here is a list ot these utilities and brief
introduction. For source code, you can find them on `my github page`_.

- `pcaptools`_: a list of updating tools to facilitate analyzing network
  traffic (or pcap files) for network researches.
- `treelib`_: an efficient implementation of tree data structure for python 2
  and 3.

  TCP/UDP flows.
- `http-sniffer`_: a multi-threaded snifing tool to extract HTTP messages into
  log files.
- `libwayback`_: a web crawler to parse historical web pages for given domain
