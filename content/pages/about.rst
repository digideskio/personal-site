I am now a Ph.D. candidate with `Prof. Yaohui Jin`_ at `Shanghai Jiao Tong
Univ.`_. I received my B.S. (2010) of Optical Information and Science
Technology at `Xidian University`_, Xi'an, China.

My research area is the measurement and analysis of mobile network traffic,
especially on the renewed models and characteristics of networks traffic,
employing statistical and machine learning techniques on distributed processing
platforms such as `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_. Based on the
large scale observation of human movement and interests in mobile networks, the
current topic I am engaging in is analyzing and understanding human spatial and
temporal behaviours from networking perspective. The derived results are
essential to uncover the general patterns and universal laws of human mobility,
and are also promising for the optimization and future protocol designs in
mobile networks. The detailed intro about each sub-topic is given at `this
place <http://xiaming.me/pages/researches.html>`_.
