I am now a Ph.D. candidate with `Prof. Yaohui Jin`_ at `Shanghai Jiao Tong
Univ.`_. I received my B.S. (2010) of Optical Information and Science
Technology at `Xidian University`_, Xi'an, China.

My research interests come from the measurement and analysis of network
traffic, especially the renewed models and characteristics of networks traffic,
with the data mining techniques and high performance processing platforms like
Network Processor and hadoop/mapreduce framework.

If you are interested in my `articles`_, `researches`_, or `projects`_, you can
reach me via email or other partially instant messages like `github`_:).
